      <em>Coinport is a fully transparent cryptocurrency exchnage.</em> The notable differences between our exchange and others is a combination of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open-sourced: our matching-engine is open-sourced on github.com.
      </li>
      <li>Open-data: we fully open account activity data, order and transaction data to the public without exposing user privacy. All these data will be available for download next day.
      </li>
      <li>Provable 100% reserve: we promise users not to take advantage of their fiat or cryptocurrencies. Each day we will publish the proof that all of their assets are kept in our bank or wallets. Users will be able to withdrawl their assets anytime they want.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Happy trading!
